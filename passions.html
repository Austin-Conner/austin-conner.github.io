    <h1>Things that make me happy.</h1>
    <p>I have a passion for <span class="passion">creativity.</span> I like to think. My mind is a safe haven. I like to look for problems and dream up solutions.<br>
        I have a passion for <span class="passion">learning.</span> I could watch YouTube all day about various topics and broaden my knowledge a video at a time. <br> I love taking pictues. <span class="passion">Photography</span> is a way for me to show others the world from my eyes.
        Helping others doing things I love to do is what makes my life worth living. <br>
        When all measures are exhausted and I need to escape, I'll turn to <span class="passion">music.</span> I like to listen deeply and finding little nuances the artist sprinkled in. If i'm around the right people, I'll even make my own.
