        <p><i>It all started when I was born...</i><br>
            Okay... I won't go that far back. I just want to tell you a <i>little bit</i> about myself. <br>
            My name's Austin Conner and I grew up near Kingwood, West Virginia. <br>
            Ever since I could remember, I was the families IT Guy. If someones computer was messed up, I was the guy to talk to.<br>
            I was constantly researching things. YouTube was my happy place. I loved finding out different ways to use technology. <br>
            I found my way to a Minecraft Sever Hosting website and that's where my curiouosity florished. <br>
            From dark to sunrise, late into the night, I was trying to make my virtual world better. 
            I had more fun managing the server than actually playing the game. <br>
            One day, my friends stopped playing and the fun went away. The server was shut down and never turned on again. <br>
            After I graduated high school, I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life. I didn't feel like I was good at anything. <br>
            A few months after graduating, I got a job working with the Geek Squad in Morgantown. Working at Best Buy put the nail in the coffin.<br> I need to be doing something in tech.
            Fast foward to now, I'm pursuing a Computer Infomation Systems Bachelors degree from WVU Potomac State College.<br>
            I'm hoping I'll gain the knowledge to allow me to see the world through a different lens. One day, I want a job that offers me a challange. I want to do something important. I want to create. I want my work to affect the world. Hopefully one day I'll achieve that, but for now...
